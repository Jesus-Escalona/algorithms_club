# Intro to Algorithms

--

An algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a task.

---
For example, you might have a morning algorithm.

--

 1. Wake up  
 2. Brush teeth  
 3. Shower  

--

etc.

# More algorithms
 - Compressing data
 - Encryption
 - Searching
 - Finding directions
 - Pretty much any process that can be broken down into small repeatable steps.

# Historical note:

> The word 'algorithm' has its roots in latinizing the name of Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in a first step to algorismus. Al-Khwārizmī (Persian: خوارزمی‎, c. 780–850) was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, geographer, and scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, whose name means 'the native of Khwarezm', a region that was part of Greater Iran and is now in Uzbekistan.

# What does this mean for us?

Pretty much any time you write a function or a helper method, you are writing some kind of algorithm.

# Using Algorithms

Sometimes it is useful to use a built-in or already worked out algorithm - someone else wrote an optimized sorting algorithm for many languages, so you don't have to. If you are doing something more complicated or specific to you, however, you should write your own.

# Using Algorithms

There are two main ways to judge algorithms:

1. Correctness - will your algorithm return the right values? What happens when you put in wrong values? What happens to edge cases?
2. Efficiency - how quickly does your algorithm run? Is there a way to make it run more efficiently?  
**Note:** We will _definitely_ return to this topic and it will probably get its own meeting of Algorithm Club. In the meantime, ask Gigi for the link to her Big O lecture.

# Algorithms and the Technical Interview

As you all probably know, many companies vet candidates by testing their ability to write algorithms, often by whiteboarding.  


**These interviews are just as much about your communication skills as your problem-solving skills.**  


As you work on problems here and in interviews, make sure you check your understanding of the question with the interviewer and talk about your approach before you start writing any function. (Again, we'll talk a bit more about this in future.)
