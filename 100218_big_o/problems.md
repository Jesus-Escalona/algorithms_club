# Big O
## Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1 and then every successive element is the sum of the previous two in the sequence.
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```
The brute force approach has a O(2^n). How might you do this problem in linear time?

## Ransom Note Checker
Given two strings representing your note and a magazine, return a boolean that tells you if you can create the note from the magazine.

*Extra Credit*:
Return something that tells me where in the magazine I can find all the words for my ransom note.

## Pair Sum
Given a sorted array and a number, return true if any pairs of numbers in the array that sum to that number, else return false.
